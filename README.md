# Anchored
game i've been wanting to make for quite a while now!  

Trello Page (private):
https://trello.com/b/PXt346qQ/anchored  

Note: I did NOT create the Tiled map rendering part. It was taken from the Monogame.Extended.Tiled library!  

Interesting Parts:
 * Collider.cs
 * EntityWorld.cs
* DebugConsole.cs
 * The whole UI Section
 * The save section
